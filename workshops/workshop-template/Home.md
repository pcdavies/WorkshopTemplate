## Standards
### Tiny URLs
It is highly suggested to use rebrandly where possible to setup tinyurls - rebrandly will let you swap out the backend URL if it neds to be changed 


```
ex: When creating a public DOCs link that expires
```

### Repository naming Conventions
Please Prefix all repositories with: TTC-< Project Descriptor/Code Descriptor >< Postfixed with intent if needed >

```
code example: TTC-CatalogApp
lab example: TTC-DevOpsLab
```

### Folder structure for Lab Guides
All Labs will ultimately be pushed up to the learning library on Oracle's GitHub. Please use the following conventions:
* root of directory will have a single folder called workshops
* within workshops you will have a single folder for your workshop
* your workshop will be named ttc-< descrptor > (ex: ttc-devops-starter-kit)
 * do **NOT** use camel case but instead separate with a dash
